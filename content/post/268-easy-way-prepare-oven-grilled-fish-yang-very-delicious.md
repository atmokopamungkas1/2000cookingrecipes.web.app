Hello everybody, it's Drew, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to make a distinctive dish, oven grilled fish. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Center it on the broiler pan or baking tray, skin side down if applicable. If you have a filet with one end that&#39;s considerably thinner than the other, tuck the thin end underneath the rest of the filet to create a fairly uniform thickness. This makes it easy for any seasoning added to it to shine through. This recipe is so simple but satisfyingly delicious.
