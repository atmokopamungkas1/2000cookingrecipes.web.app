1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

In a large skillet over medium high heat, warm the olive oil. This is one of those dishes where, if you tasted the chicken and sauce separately, you probably wouldn&#39;t be very impressed, but together they&#39;re magic. As the skin is removed you&#39;ll need to do this over a lower temperature than usual and give them a good wiggle around to prevent them sticking to the dish. Add the rest of the ingredients to the casserole. Heat on the hob and stir until the sauce has thickened slightly.
