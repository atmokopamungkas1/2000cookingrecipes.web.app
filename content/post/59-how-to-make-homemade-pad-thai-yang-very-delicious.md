Hello everybody, it's Jim, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, homemade pad thai. One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

The Noodles Pad Thai is made with flat dried rice noodles which can be found in everyday supermarkets. I recommend Chang&#39;s &#34;Thai style&#34; rice noodles rather than the actual Thai brand rice noodles (Erawan Rice Sticks - red pack below) that are sold at supermarkets. Pad Thai is essentially a stir-fry and requires little more than chopping and stirring. It comes together in less than a half-hour.
