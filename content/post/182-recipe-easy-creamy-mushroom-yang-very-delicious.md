Butter AND oil - because oil can be heated to a high temperature than butter which makes it easier to make the mushrooms golden brown and avoids burnt butter; and Pasta type - use any long strand pasta you want here. I have a preference for fettuccine or linguine for creamy pastas because there&#39;s more surface area for the creamy sauce to cling to! You can find crème fraîche in most grocery stores. It&#39;s a soured cream that is soured with bacterial culture.
