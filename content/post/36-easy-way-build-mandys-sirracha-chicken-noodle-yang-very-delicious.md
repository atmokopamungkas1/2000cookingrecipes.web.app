Just threw it all together and it was a hit( the picture isn&#39;t the best but the taste is amazing) It&#39;s based off my Mongolian Beef but instead of Asian Sweet Chili Sauce, I have combined honey and Sriracha for sweet heat along with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and splashes of hoisin (like Asian barbecue sauce) and mirin (Japanese sweet cooking rice wine). This new sriracha chicken recipe shows why we&#39;re known for quick cooked workday meals here at Rock Recipes. I&#39;ve come to become a little addicted to Sriracha hot sauce in the past year, using it practically like ketchup on everything from steak to poached eggs.
