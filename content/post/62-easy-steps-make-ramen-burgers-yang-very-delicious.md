Hello everybody, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, ramen burgers. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Ramen burgers is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. They're nice and they look wonderful. Ramen burgers is something which I have loved my whole life.

Instant ramen becomes a nearly-instant burger bun in this fun, and tasty, spin on a traditional hamburger seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil. Drain and rinse noodles with cold water. Most ramen burgers combine a seasoned, glazed burger patty with scallions and slip it into a bun made with ramen bound together with eggs and cooked on a flat-top. For my version, which starts with instant ramen, I replace the glaze with a bit of the seasoning mix from the packet, and forgo the eggs altogether, giving you a much more ramen-y bun.


To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have ramen burgers using 9 ingredients and 0 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

Make burgers: In a large bowl, combine beef, jalapeño, onion, spring onion and garlic powder. Place one half in one ramekin dish, the other half in a second ramekin dish. It&#39;s a warm pile of ramen noodles, topped with a cheeseburger, a little bacon, some chopped greens and if you want to get extra fancy, a drizzle of sesame oil over the whole thing. We make ours from just four simple ingredients—water, soybeans, wheat, and salt.
